# processo-seletivo1

This was a test I received from a company for a front-end first stage. I was very happy that in the first 2 months of studies I received this request. It is already my third selection process at the moment.

The objective of this project was to develop a website based on the psd and the image below:

<hr>
<img src="img/LayoutTeste.jpg">
<hr>

How I developed the work:

I developed the proposed model and left all the points that had a link with the "#". In addition to the buttons to open tabs or whats as points to be edited.

I used my knowledge with: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.113 and learned to use OwlCarousel2 2.3.4
